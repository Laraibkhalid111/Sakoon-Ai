# Sakoon AI 🫶

> **A calm space to talk** / بات کرنے کی ایک پرسکون جگہ

Sakoon AI is a free, bilingual (Urdu + English, voice or text) mental wellness companion built with Streamlit and Groq. It listens without judgment, gently explores what you're going through, offers grounding techniques in the moment, builds a personalized recovery plan, and delivers a clean PDF summary — while a deterministic safety layer ensures anyone in genuine crisis is never left with just a chatbot reply.
